I recently uploaded <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ukulele.captainhampton.ukulelechords">"Ukulele Trainer"</a>: a simple Android application that is inspired by my own desire to teach myself how to play the ukulele. I've played guitar for over 15 years, so many of the mechanics and the little music theory that I know carry over quite well. Still, my music theory is anything but great, and by working on this project, I've gained a slightly better understanding of music theory which I hope to continue. 

Ukulele's are inexpensive, fun, and relatively easy to learn. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY">Josh Kaufman's excellent TED talk</a> on learning anything in 20 hours, where at the end of the talk, he applies his principle to the ukulele. Optimistically, this humble application can help you to achieve a similar goal.

Here are a couple screen shots of Ukulele Trainer and a video to show off a bit more of the features that are provided. More information can be found on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ukulele.captainhampton.ukulelechords">Ukulele Trainer link on the Google PlayStore</a>.

Here are a few screen shots showcasing the functionality of the app that allows a user to find and hear a ukulele chord. Chords are the building blocks of most songs, so having a quick way to access chord diagrams is key to learning to play.

Of course, in order to play the ukulele it must be tuned properly. There is a simple tuner functionality that plays a note for each string, and also provides a couple alternate tunings as well.

There is also something called a "chord sequencer". Basically, when you're playing a song, it usually consists of more than just a single chord. It's nice to have chord diagrams for all of the chords you need in the song on the same screen instead of looking up each chord as you need it.

And to top it off, here's a quick video showcasing the functionality of the app:

If you have an Android device, feel free to download the application and give it a try! If you have any improvements, suggestions, or crash reports, please let me know in the comments section or via email. Furthermore, if you're an Android developer and want to check out the project, I've open sourced the whole thing, and it can be cloned at the <a href="https://github.com/vprusso/android_ukulele">android_ukulele Github repository</a>. 

Thanks again, and happy strumming!

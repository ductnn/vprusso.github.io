Each year I try to set a goal to read a certain number of books. In 2016, <a href="http://vprusso.github.io/blog/2017/my-top-books-read-in-2016/">I read 100 books for the year</a>. You can see my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/3739547">Goodreads Challenge for 2016 here</a>. In this post, I'll be giving a one sentence description of the books that I've read in 2017, and a symbol after the sentence to give an indication as to what I thought of the book. Namely:

* Good : :+1:
* Okay : :ok_hand:
* Meh : :shit:

These books are in no particular order and the release dates of the books are not restricted to 2017. The best book I read this year is: "A Confession" by Leo Tolstoy. 

So without further ado:
